# Transformer Model Implementation

Author: Damir Kanymkulov

This GitHub repository includes the implementations of the main components of the transformer model, along with the code for my final project. Below is an overview of the structure and components of this repository. 

# Repository Structure
The "transformer_project" folder contains "modelling", "run", "test", and "final_project_code" folders. The general implementations of the main components of the transformer model are in the folder "modelling". Dataset, encoder, and decoder implementations are also in the "modelling" folder. The "run" folder includes the following files: "training.py" and "translate.py". Within the "final_project_code" folder, the performances of the encoder-decoder and the decoder-only architecture are compared using a dataset of polynomial functions (representing the input sequence) and their respective f(x)-values for different x inputs (representing the output sequence).
