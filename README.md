# Transformer Model Implementation

Author: Damir Kanymkulov

This GitHub repository includes the implementations from the practicals, along with the code for my final project. Below is an overview of the structure and components of this repository. 

# Repository Structure
"transformer_project" folder contains "modelling", "run", "test", and "final_project_code" folders. The general implementations of the main components of the transformer model are in the folder "modelling". Dataset, encoder, and decoder implementations are also in the "modelling" folder. The "run" folder includes the following files: "training.py", "translate.py", and "main.py". All the code for the experiments of the final project is contained in the folder "final_project_code".
